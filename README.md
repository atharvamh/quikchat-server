# Using Mongoose
Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modelling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationship between data, provides schema validation, and it is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB

MongoDB is a schemaless NoSQL document database. Any non-structured JSON documents can be stored in mongo which speeds up application development and reduces deployment complexity
